## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a website or web application that is visible to the user. It is the side where the user interacts with the system.

### User Interface
Frontend is responsible for creating the look of the website. It includes buttons, text, images, forms, colors, and page design. Everything that the user sees on the screen is made using frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### User Interaction
Frontend handles all user actions like clicking a button, filling a form, scrolling the page, or submitting data. It also shows messages like errors, success messages, and loading screens.

### Communication with Backend
Frontend sends requests to the backend to get or send data. For example, when a user logs in, the frontend sends the login details to the backend and shows the response that comes from the server.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the part of the application that works behind the scenes. The user cannot see it directly, but it does all the important work.

### Server-side Processing
Backend receives requests from the frontend and processes them. For example, it checks login details, calculates results, or processes any form data.

### Database Handling
Backend is responsible for storing data in the database and getting data from it. For example, saving user details, fetching product information, or updating records.

### Security and Authentication
Backend handles security of the application. It checks user login, protects passwords, and makes sure that only allowed users can access certain data.

## Q3. Business Logic

Business logic means the rules of the application that decide how the system should work. It controls what is allowed and what is not allowed in the application.

### Examples of Business Logic:

1. **Shopping Website**
   - If the total bill is more than 1000, then give discount.
   - If an item is out of stock, the user cannot place the order.

2. **Bank Application**
   - A user cannot withdraw more money than the available balance.
   - A user cannot transfer more than the daily limit.

3. **College Website**
   - A student cannot fill the exam form if fees are not paid.
   - A student must have minimum attendance to give exam.

These rules are part of business logic and are very important for correct working of the system.

## Q4. Client–Server Model

Client–Server model is a way of building applications where the work is divided between two parts: client and server.

### Who is the Client?
Client is the user’s device or browser like Chrome or Edge. It sends requests to the server and shows the result to the user.

### Who is the Server?
Server is a computer that stores data and runs the backend code. It processes the requests coming from the client.

### How Communication Happens?
The client sends a request to the server using internet. The server processes it and sends back a response. This happens using HTTP.

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-Tier Architecture means dividing the application into three parts.

### Presentation Layer
This is the frontend part. It shows the website and takes input from the user.

### Application (Business) Layer
This is the backend logic part. It processes the data and applies rules.

### Data Layer
This part handles the database. It stores and fetches data.

### Why This Architecture is Used?
- It makes the project easy to manage
- It is more secure
- It is easy to update and maintain
- Different parts can be worked on separately

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is not only used in browser, it is also used in backend using Node.js.

### Performance
Node.js is fast and can handle many users at the same time because it works in asynchronous way.

### Ecosystem
JavaScript has a very big collection of packages and libraries which makes development easy and fast.

### Popular Backend Frameworks
Some popular backend frameworks of JavaScript are:
- Express.js
- NestJS
- Fastify

Because of this, JavaScript is widely used for backend development.
